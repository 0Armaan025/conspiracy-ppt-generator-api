# Conspiracy PPT Generator API

This is the api that would help convert your theories into ppts
<br>
To run this, do the following: ``git clone https://github.com/0Armaan025/conspiracy-ppt-generator-api``, make sure you have python, and pip installed.
<br>
``cd conspiracy-ppt-generator-api``, to get into the folder, and then you can use ``code .`` to open it in vscode or directly write: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
<br>
Version: 3.12.x works amazingly!
<br>
then go to .env.local, and change the name from ``.env.local`` to ``.env`` and add your api keys.
<br>
then run this command: ``python main.py``, make sure the address is something like: ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``.
<br>
And this works! ü•≥
